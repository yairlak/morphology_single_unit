    The experiment lasts around <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Please take it
    <strong>in one go</strong>,
    alone, in a quiet setting, while remaining focused. Your efforts are
    crucial for the collected data to be interpretable.

    used.
    </p>

    <p>
    The experiment is completely anonymous. Only your answers and response
    times will be collected and analyzed. The results from this experiment
    might be used in scientific publications or presentations. There are no
    known risks in this study. You are welcome to ask questions about
